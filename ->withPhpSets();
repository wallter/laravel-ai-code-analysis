**Next Steps:**

1. **Update `rector.php`:**
   - Replace `SetList::PHP_84` with `SetList::PHP_82` as shown above.

2. **Verify Composer Configuration:**
   - Ensure that your `composer.json` correctly specifies the PHP version.
   - Since you're using PHP **8.2**, no changes are needed in `composer.json` unless you intend to upgrade PHP.

3. **Run Lint Again:**
   - After updating `rector.php`, execute `composer run lint` to verify that the issue is resolved.
   - The command should now run both `pint` and `rector` without errors.

4. **Additional Recommendations:**
   - **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Ensure that all your Composer dependencies, especially Rector, are up-to-date to avoid compatibility issues.
   - **Check Rector Documentation:** Familiarize yourself with Rector's [official documentation](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector) for advanced configurations and best practices.

By aligning the PHP versions in both `composer.json` and `rector.php`, you should eliminate the error and allow `composer run lint` to execute successfully.
