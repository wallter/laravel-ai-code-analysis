create view(s) for `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/StaticAnalysisToolController.php` `store` functions. Ensure the views are reusable and/or reuse
d components used in for other (Admin) views. Ensure that the view functions as expected and has an intuitive interface. Impliment one at a time
 and ensure it will work end to end. The views should be like `resources/views/admin/ai_models` but have their own folder/etc.

 Ask the user what controller/endpoint they would like to create a view for.
