# Concepts Used in This Repository

## Overview

To maintain clarity and understanding of the codebase, each relevant directory and namespace should include a `README.md` file detailing the concepts associated with that segment. This practice ensures that developers can quickly grasp the purpose and functionality of different parts of the project.

## Guidelines

- **Directory-Level Documentation:**
  - Each directory containing significant functional or architectural components should have a `README.md` that outlines the concepts, patterns, and functionalities implemented within.
  
- **Namespace-Level Documentation:**
  - Each PHP namespace should have a corresponding `README.md` that elaborates on the purpose and structure of the classes and interfaces within that namespace.
  
- **Consistency:**
  - Ensure all documentation follows a consistent format, making it easy for developers to locate and comprehend the concepts.
  
- **Regular Updates:**
  - As the codebase evolves, update the documentation to reflect new concepts or changes to existing ones.
  
- **Example Structure:**
  - `app/Services/Parsing/README.md` - Documentation of parsing-related services and their concepts.
  - `app/Services/AI/README.md` - Documentation of AI-related services and their concepts.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Onboarding:**
  - New developers can quickly understand the architecture and key components of the project.
  
- **Reference for Architectural Decisions:**
  - Serves as a living document for the rationale behind certain design choices and patterns used.
  
- **Improved Maintainability:**
  - Facilitates easier maintenance and scalability by providing clear documentation of existing concepts.
  
- **Consistency Across the Codebase:**
  - Promotes uniform understanding and implementation of concepts throughout the project.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Identify Relevant Directories and Namespaces:**
   - Review the project structure to determine which directories and namespaces would benefit from detailed documentation.

2. **Create `README.md` Files:**
   - For each identified directory or namespace, create a `README.md` file.
   
3. **Document Key Concepts:**
   - In each `README.md`, outline the core concepts, design patterns, and functionalities implemented.
   
4. **Maintain and Update Documentation:**
   - Regularly update the `README.md` files to reflect any changes or additions to the concepts within each segment.

## Example `README.md` Structure
