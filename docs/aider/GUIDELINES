1. Language
   - Always respond in English.

2. Code Standards
   - Use Laravel 11+ best practices and PSR-12 style.
   - Write PHP 8.4+ with appropriate types.
   - Keep classes and functions concise; use OOP principles when necessary.
   - Begin PHP files with `<?php`, and import all classes with `use`.
   - Leverage Laravel Collections and helpers when possible.

3. Documentation
   - Provide short phpdoc blocks (brief descriptions, tags).
   - Explain the "why" rather than the "what" in comments.
   - Inline comments should be reduced in favor of more descriptive method names or breaking down complex logic into smaller methods.
   - Keep READMEs in directories/namespaces for key concepts.

4. Testing
   - Include at least one test (unit or feature) for every new or updated feature.

5. Commands
   - Avoid modifying `app/Console/Kernel.php`. Laravel 11 automatically discovers commands.

6. Iterative Changes
   - Make small, incremental edits to avoid complexity.
   - Refactor large changes in manageable steps.

7. Code Quality
   - Maintain clean, modular, and reusable code.
   - Ensure seamless integration with Laravel 11 features and ecosystem.
