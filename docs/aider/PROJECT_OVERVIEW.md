## 1. Purpose

We are building an **automated documentation and code-analysis system** for a **Laravel** app. The system will:
1. Enhance documentation and code understanding by storing and utilizing Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).
2. Store parse results in a database for queries, refactoring assistance, or doc generation.
3. Leverage AI services to expand or refine documentation using detailed context from ASTs.
4. Provide Artisan commands for core operations (e.g., `parse:files`, `generate:tests`).
